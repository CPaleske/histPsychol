An Online History of Psychology Textbook

Eventually I hope this reposistory will hold the files for an online textbook of psychology. The plan is to use the Sphinx documentation system for the basic display with the actual book hosted on readthedocs and exportable from there. Of course anyone wanting to clone the book for their own purposes is encouraged to do so, as well as edit, amend or add to the book with a pull request. Futher descriptions of that process will follow. And while I am freely giving up my copyrights with a CC0 license, any works of others referenced or quoted in the present work are subject to the original copyrights of their creators or copyright holders.
