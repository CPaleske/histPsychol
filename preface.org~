* A meandering introduction
This book grew from my notes and experience teaching the History of Psychology course at the [[https://uwaterloo.ca/][University of Waterloo]]. I started teaching this course in Jan 2008. 
I was assigned this course for a couple of reasons. Most importantly, I was the newest departmental member, and really had no idea what I could or should say yes and no to. 
Secondarily, I had a background in Neurology where eponyms are common. 
By virtue of my common use of the names of physicians of long ago I was viewed as at least an historian manque.

I was very anxious that first year. 
While I knew a lot about the brain and behavior my background was not psychology /per se/. \
Fortunately, I was deluged with examination copies of textbooks on the topics.
Many were very good. 
All were expensive.

They were also very similar.
Why shouldn't they be?
There is a canonical view of psychology as a science.
The various books did not differ in content as much as they differed in style and in depth. 
There were small differences in coverage that usually revolved around how far back the author wanted to go into the philosophical origins, and occassionally in later movements, e.g. whether psychoanalysis was included.

That first year these books saved me.
I read many of them in developing and preparing my own lectures, and used the consistency of their treatments to help me organize my own content. 
Disappointed by the expense, and in an effort to avoid redundancy between the readings and the lectures, I chose a small, and relatively inexpensive [[http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&bcsId=4849&itemId=140513206X][textbook]] as the course's required text. 

What surprised me about these textbooks was that each year I kept getting more and more of them.
Why were so many redundant texts necessary?
Why were new editions released yearly?
My guess is money.
History of Psychology courses are common components of psychology curricula.
Each publisher wants their own offering.
Writing a widely adopted text can be very [[http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2011/02/04/the_house_that_math_built.html][lucrative]] for the authors.
And by putting out a new edition every year, which given that new scholarship doesn't accumulate that rapidly for historical topics cannot be justified based on pedagogical principles, the re-use of books from previous terms is discouraged.
Looking at these editions from one year to the next I could often not tell what had changed.
Often the covers were the same.
I began to develop conspiracy theories.
When I saw that a collection of original articles, with annotations, was selling for over $60 Canadian I began to feel that the students were being taken advantage of.

At one point in time this packaging and reselling of old works with commentary could have been justified, but not anymore.
This is the internet age, and there are wonderful resources for letting students read the original works easily.
In many cases the expiration of copyright allows for the originals to be redistributed. 
In most North American Universities the library's subscription allows access to repositories like JSTOR that have all the old, classic psychology journals on line (the APA does this as well).
Why have my students pay $100 for a textbook and a collection of readings, when I could give them links to the originals and we could use our class time for discussion.
