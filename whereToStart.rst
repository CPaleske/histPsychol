1 Where to begin?
-----------------

The questions which motivate many to study psychology are ancient. Thus one could easily justify starting with the Greeks: Plato, Aristotle, and many less well known thinkers who had views on consciousness, perception, memory, and emotions --- all topics of contemporary interest  [1]_ . And while that choice would lead to interesting discussions and readings, and while it would give rise to an informed context for modern debates, it would not advance those debates. The same questions reappear across the centuries, are not resolved, and leave little sense of progress. One should look closer to modern times to frame the stage for scientific psychology's origin.

But one should not leap too far. Jumping all the way to Wilhelm Wundt and `1879 <http://psychologie.biphaps.uni-leipzig.de/hist.html>`_, the year that is commonly used to mark the founding of Experimental Psychology, would omit a statement of the problem that a *scientific* psychology was meant to solve. Psychology emerges from philosophy, both abstractly, the contents of the inquiry, and concretely, from its people and departments. Why? What was wrong with the contemporary state of the art that demanded new methods? In fact, demanded a new `science <https://archive.org/stream/grundzgederphys15wundgoog#page/n22/mode/1up>`_? One that connected the knowledge, procedure and rigor of physiology, with the bifurcated domain of rationalist and empiricist mental philosophy. 

In looking to the stories of Descartes and Locke we see early statements of the rationalist and empiricist positions. We are greeted by questions, such as the one that was posed by Molyneux, that are still generating modern discussion and research. And by picking this time we enter history when it becomes possible to conceive of science *per se.* Prior to Galileo one could argue there was no science  [2]_ .

2 Philosophers and Psychology

2.1 Descartes (1596 - 1650)

Descartes was a genius and polymath. His inclusion here rests not on the content of his substance dualist claim that mind and matter were two different things, but on the fact that in making this claim he was pulling together the topics of introspective philosophy and physiology. Descartes maintained that matter was physical, and the mind was not. They were two substances (*Res cogitans* and *Res extensa*) yet they interacted. Mind could influence matter and thus thought could determine behavior. In this rapprochement between brain and spirit Descartes presages the creation of a science of psychology which will take thought and its physical basis as its content. 

Descartes is also relevant for his metaphysics. He famously proposed "`*Je pense, donc je suis* <https://archive.org/stream/discoursdel00desc#page/22/mode/2up/search/%22je+pense+donc+je+suis%22>`_." I think therefore I am. [3]_  His method of doubt, and the specific conclusions he reached from employing it may be more pertinent to epistemology, but for scientific psychology they demonstrate the critical use of introspection. Descartes imagined some trickster was deluding his senses. What was it he could believe given the risk of this deceiving demon? We have all been deceived by dreams and illusions - at least momentarily. Given that, is it not possible that all is illusion? That all we perceive is false. That all we know is wrong. No, replied Descartes. There is always somthing that thinks, and that is constant in its identity across time. I think. Therfore I am. There can be no doubt of this concludes Descartes (and many others). It is an example of the careful use of one's own internal conscious representations and reasonings as the basis for a scientific claim. This will be the method most central to early scientific psychology, and we can take this example of its early deployment as a herald for the scientific psychology to follow. 

2.1.1 Some Biography [4]_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the above show how the ideas of Descartes, his rationality and his use of instrospection, indicate the science yet to come, we can also see in Descartes' life the practices that would be developed to support all the sciences including psychology. 

He was born the son of a sort of lawyer and regional politician. His mother died within a year of his birth, and Descartes was raised by a grandmother. He was deemed sickly. Possibly tuberculosis, and possibly contracted from his mother. He had two inheritances: one monetary and one his intelligence. The latter seems to have been the way he purchased indulgences. Even at a Jesuit school there was a tolerance for his sleeping in and working in bed. `Some words by Descartes about his own schooling. <http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Descartes_schooling.html>`_

He acquired a degree in law in Paris.  Even in those days guardians were interested in making sure that an education provided you a way to make a living, and also in those days young men and women entertained questions about purpose and meaning. Descartes seems to have had his crisis in his early twenties. What good was his knowledge? In his own existential crisis he volunteered for the army  [5]_ , and became a mercenary for Holland against Spanish forces in the Thirty Years War. While developing and teaching artillery techniques he still seems to have been indulged in a degree of military tolerance. Because it was at this time that he apparently retired to his oven to meditate and in the course of three vivid dreams developed his mental philosophy.  

Descartes is also the man behind the Cartesian coordinate system. He was an accomplished mathematician and his coordinate system is a small component of the revolution he created by showing the connection between algebra and geometry. Algebra presents math as formulas. Geometry as drawings. Descartes showed how you could move back and forth. Take your compass and draw a circle on the page of radius :math:`r`. That image can also be expressed as a function :math:`x^2 + y^2 = r`. Work in the "domain" that is most convenient and then convert back into the other. Troubled by a geometric problem? Translate it into algebra. Solve the hard part there, and then translate the solution back into geometry. 

These mathematical experiences are key to all scientific inquiry. To study something you must be able to measure it. Mathematizing experience is for Kant the essence of a science, and even if we don't go as far as Kant. We can see the idea of trying to quantify experience as a key feature of the nascent struggles to move psychological investigations beyond its idiosyncratic character. `Herbart <http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/hop/2/3/163.html>`_ is one of the first to try and give a mathematical tone to `psychological theorizing <https://archive.org/details/textbookinpsycho1891herb>`_, and it will be Fechner and then Helmholtz who successfully fuse quantification with measurement to generate theories of thought. In Descartes we see the early development of mathematical ideas as providing a dictionary for translating between scientific domains.


.. [1] Two textbooks that give reasonably extended treatments of these ancient sources are `The Great Psychologists <http://www.alibris.com/The-Great-Psychologists-A-History-of-Psychological-Thought-Robert-Irving-Watson/book/23787480?matches=16>`_ by Robert I. Watson (which can be found very cheaply on line), and `Connections in the History and Systems of Psychology <http://www.amazon.com/Connections-History-Systems-Psychology-Michael/dp/0618415122>`_ by B. Michael Thorne and Tracy B. Henley, which is newer, but more expensive.

.. [2] A useful question to consider at this stage is whether or not you agree with this statement: Before Galileo there was nothing *we* would call a science. To have an opinion on that you will not only need to know a little bit more about Galileo and what it was he did, but also what is meant by the word science. What makes something justifiably called "a science?" You might find this `interview with David Wootton <https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/sep/21/history-scientific-revolution-david-wootton>`_ relevant.

.. [3] Yet another way in which Descartes was a forward thinker was in writing his science, at least initially, in the vernacular (Galileo did this too). Rather than latin (Cogito ergo sum) his first phrasing of "I think therefore I am." was in French. By writing in his national language he made his writing more accessible to those without a classical background. Paradoxically, this may have made some of his work less accessible to the non-French for whom Latin was the international language of scientific discourse. Of course, one could always relay on breeding. What educated European of the time wouldn't have had at least a basic reading level knowledge of French, German, and Italian?

.. [4] My own notes on Descartes life are all secondary and acquire piecemeal. I can't recall the sources for most of them. They are just a big pile of facts that I use to lecture. However, did find this `site <http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Descartes.html>`_ that offers a very nice overview.

.. [5] `Wittgenstein too volunteered for the army <http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-wittgenstein.htm>`_. What is it with famous philosophers and enlistment? This same `website <http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-descartes.htm>`_ has a nice article about Descartes military experience.
