1 Where to begin?
-----------------

The questions which motivate many to study psychology are ancient. Thus one could easily justify starting with the Greeks: Plato, Aristotle, and many less well known thinkers who had views on consciousness, perception, memory, and emotions --- all topics of contemporary interest  [1]_ . And while that choice would lead to interesting discussions and readings, and while it would give rise to an informed context for modern debates, it would not advance those debates. The same questions reappear across the centuries, are not resolved, and leave little sense of progress. One should look closer to modern times to frame the stage for scientific psychology's origin.

But one should not leap too far. Jumping all the way to Wilhelm Wundt and `1879 <http://psychologie.biphaps.uni-leipzig.de/hist.html>`_, the year that is commonly used to mark the founding of Experimental Psychology, would omit a statement of the problem that a *scientific* psychology was meant to solve. Psychology emerges from philosophy, both abstractly, the contents of the inquiry, and concretely, from its people and departments. Why? What was wrong with the contemporary state of the art that demanded new methods? In fact, demanded a new `science <https://archive.org/stream/grundzgederphys15wundgoog#page/n22/mode/1up>`_? One that connected the knowledge, procedure and rigor of physiology, with the bifurcated domain of rationalist and empiricist mental philosophy. 

In looking to the stories of Descartes and Locke we see early statements of the rationalist and empiricist positions. We are greeted by questions, such as the one that was posed by Molyneux, that are still generating modern discussion and research. And by picking this time we enter history when it becomes possible to conceive of science *per se.* Prior to Galileo one could argue there was no science  [2]_ .

.. [1] Two textbooks that give reasonably extended treatments of these ancient sources are `The Great Psychologists <http://www.alibris.com/The-Great-Psychologists-A-History-of-Psychological-Thought-Robert-Irving-Watson/book/23787480?matches=16>`_ by Robert I. Watson (which can be found very cheaply on line), and `Connections in the History and Systems of Psychology <http://www.amazon.com/Connections-History-Systems-Psychology-Michael/dp/0618415122>`_ by B. Michael Thorne and Tracy B. Henley, which is newer, but more expensive.

.. [2] A useful question to consider at this stage is whether or not you agree with this statement: Before Galileo there was nothing *we* would call a science. To have an opinion on that you will not only need to know a little bit more about Galileo and what it was he did, but also what is meant by the word science. What makes something justifiably called "a science?" You might find this `interview with David Wootton <https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/sep/21/history-scientific-revolution-david-wootton>`_ relevant.
